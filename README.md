# Disease-Prediction-using-Symptoms
We set out to create a system which can predict disease on the basis of symptoms given to it. Such a system can decrease the rush at OPDs of hospitals and reduce the workload on medical staff. We were successful in creating such a system and use 4 different algorithm to do so. On an average we achieved accuracy of ~94%.
