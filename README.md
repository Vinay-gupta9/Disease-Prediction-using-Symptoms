# Disease-Prediction-using-Symptoms
We set out to create a system which can predict disease on the basis of symptoms given to it. Such a system can decrease the rush at OPDs of hospitals and reduce the workload on medical staff. We were successful in creating such a system and use 4 different algorithm to do so. On an average we achieved accuracy of ~94%.
# Problem Statement
Health information needs are also changing the information seeking behavior and can be observed around the globe. Challenges faced by many people are looking online for health information regarding diseases, diagnoses and different treatments. If a recommendation system can be made for doctors and medicine while using review mining will save a lot of time. In this type of system, the user face problem in understanding the heterogeneous medical vocabulary as the users are laymen. User is confused because a large amount of medical information on different mediums are available.The idea behind recommender system is to adapt to cope with the special requirements of the health domain related with users.

# Work Flow
In this project we have used four different algorithms 

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbour

Naive Bayes Classifier

All the four Algorithms predict the disease as a result when the user enter  the symtoms of diseases.

Our Dataset consist of training and testing file which contains 5000+ rows to predict the diseases.

All the used algorithm gives an accuracy of more than 90%.
